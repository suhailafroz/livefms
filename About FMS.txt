The GHMC Flood Early Warning System measures and monitors water levels along the khairatabad zone within hyderabad on a real-time basis in order to help infor area residents of potentially dangerous weather conditions.

The GHMCFEWS also provides historical rainfall data and information about past flooding events.

The System relies on the different stations strategically placed throughout the zone.  The individual station contain sensors that transmit valuable data during rain events.  

Reliable rainfall amounts and water level data can help emergency management officials make critical decisions that ultimately aid in reducing the risk of property damage, injuries and loss of life.

The topographic elevation data, also known as Digital Eleation Model (DEM) is the most
                    important input data to any urban flood modal and the quality of th DEM directly
                    influence the result of the model.
                    As a prerequisite for the construction of the flood model, a high-resolution digital
                    elevation model (DEM) is mandatory.
                    This DEM would be generated from high-resolution multispectral stereo satellite data
                    (Worldview - 03).

ITE & C Department, Government of Telangana has conceptualized a project to develop an
                    early warning system for urban flooding in Hyderabad.
                    The main objective of this asssignment is the preparation of a floodmodel and implement
                    it along with a dashboard.
                    Modelling of urban flooding is important in order to reproduce the runoff behaviour and
                    simulate the flood depth.
                    The resuts of the simulation also provide a clear understanding of the drainage system.
                    Thus, information acquired from the simulation results helps the engineers and planners
                    to take necessary steps for the possible renovations and improvements of the hydraulic
                    capacity.
